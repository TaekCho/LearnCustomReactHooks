# LearnCustomReactHooks

## Rules of Hooks

### 1. Only call hooks inside of Component Functions || Other Hook Functions
### 1. Only call hooks on the top level

<hr>

## Why need Custom Hooks?
When using some logic that needs to be used in different places, you put it into a function and use it multiple times.


<strong>BUT</strong> when the function contains react hooks in it, it will fail because hooks can only be used in components.

Hence, <strong>Custom Hooks.</strong>
